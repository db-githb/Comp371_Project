**Model Manipulation**:
w = up

s = down

shift+a = translate left (translate along -x axis)

shift+d = translate right (translate along +x axis)

a = rotate anti-clockwise (around the y-axis)

d = rotate clockwise (around the y-axis)

u = scale up

j = scale down

r = shuffle model's object (generate random object for model)

f = return to original object

**Camera Manipulation**:

left arrow key = pan left (along -x axis)

right arrow key = pan right (along +x axis)

up arrow key = move forward (along -z axis)

down arrow key = move backwards (along +z axis)

while right mouse button pressed, use mouse movement in x-direction to pan camera

while middle mouse button pressed, use mouse movement in y-direction to tilt camera

while left mouse button pressed, use mouse movement to zoom
