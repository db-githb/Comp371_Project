# Comp371_Project

**MUST BE BUILT IN X86 (WIN32) !!!!**

**executable can be run from the release folder**

**it must be run from the Quiz1_21875841 folder**

- 2 = decrease volume  
- 9 = mute musice  
- 0 = mute effects

**Model Manipulation**:

- d = rotate clockwise (around the y-axis)  
- w = rotate clockwise (around the x-axis)  
- s = rotate anti-clockwise (around the x-axis)  

**Camera Manipulation**:

- left arrow key = pan left (along -x axis)  
- right arrow key = pan right (along +x axis)  
- up arrow key = move forward (along -z axis)  
- down arrow key = move backwards (along +z axis)  
- while right mouse button pressed, use mouse movement in x-direction to pan camera  
- while middle mouse button pressed, use mouse movement in y-direction to tilt camera  
- while left mouse button pressed, use mouse movement to zoom
